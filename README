These are all of the source code files that I wrote while taking Mont Hubbard's
multibody dynamics class in the Winter of 2006. It includes learning autolev
and my bicycle dynamics class project which took me forever to figure out. This
was the first time I'd worked with the Whipple bicycle model. These may be
useful to someone but beware that many may have bugs and errors or may not even
be giving the correct answers. If fact I don't think that any of these files
correctly derive the exact linear equations of motion of the whipple bicycle as
presented in Meijaard, et al. 2007, although they are very close. My project
paper on the bicycle can be found here:
http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/jkm/bh_mypapers/Low%20Speed%20Bicycle%20Stability%20-%20Effects%20of%20Geometric%20Parameters%202006.pdf.
These files were used to generate the (mostly correct) results in that paper.

BICYCLE[1-14].AL were my first attempts at deriving the equations of motion of
the bicycle. BICYCLE14.AL and FINDQ8.AL were the final versions used to
generate the data for the project paper.

bike_inertia.m, arm.m, leg.m, evalprimes.m uses the equations of motion
generated with BICYCLE14.AL and FINdQ8.AL to generate the data in the project
paper. It generates estimates of the parameters for a bicycle and rider just
based off of geometric measurments and the rider's mass.

thomasbike.al was written by another student, Thomas Engelhardt, and may
generate the equations of motion correctly.
