These are all of the source code files that I wrote while taking Mont Hubbard's
multibody dynamics class in the Winter of 2006. It includes learning autolev
and my bicycle dynamics class project which took me forever to figure out. This
was the first time I'd worked with the Whipple bicycle model. These may be
useful to someone but beware that many may have bugs and errors or may not even
be giving the correct answers. If fact I don't think that any of these files
correctly derive the exact linear equations of motion of the whipple bicycle as
presented in Meijaard, et al. 2007, although they are very close. My project
paper on the bicycle can be found here:
http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/jkm/bh_mypapers/Low%20Speed%20Bicycle%20Stability%20-%20Effects%20of%20Geometric%20Parameters%202006.pdf.
These files were used to generate the (mostly correct) results in that paper.
